# EMART

In this repository, all results obtained in EMART experimentation are collected.
Each folder is coupled with the correspondent Research Question (RQ) as described in the paper.
In the RQ1 and RQ2 folders results in terms of MSE and Variance are organized considering:
-	the true operational profile: profile1, profile2, profile3 and variable profile
-	the error attached to relative estimated profiles: 10%, 90%

In pictures both EMART results and Operational Testing (OT) results are reported.
The RQ3 contains all results of the cost-benefit analysis considering both MSE and Variance.
All considerations on results representation are consistent with what specified in the paper.
